## Overview

### What is it?

Ambient is framework in Go for building web apps using plugins. You can use the plugins already included to stand up a blog just like the [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev/) or create your own plugins to build your own web app.

### Why was this created?

Each time I write a new web app, there is a lot of reuse of foundational code. I created Ambient to help myself standardize existing code, enable/disable packages on demand, modify plugin behaviors using a configurable settings page, and build new functionality in a reusable way.

### Who is this for?

Ambient will probably appeal to individual developers or small development teams who need to build one or many web apps using a pluggable framework. Large teams will probably want a more established framework - but if you find it works well, drop me a [line](/../../issues/new) üòÅ .

### How does it work?

Ambient is a web server that accepts an app name, app version, logger, storage system, and a collection of plugins (which must include a session manager, router, and template engine).

Plugins:
- have to satisfy [interfaces](ambient.go) in order to work with Ambient.
- must request permissions and the admin must grant each permission.
- can modify or interact with almost any part of a web app:
  - logger
  - session manager
  - router
  - middleware
  - template engine
  - pages or API endpoints
  - content for HTML head, content, navigation, footer, etc.

A [pluginmanager plugin](plugin/pluginmanager/pluginmanager.go) is included that allows you to:
  - Enable/disable a plugin
  - Grant permissions to a plugin
  - Modify the settings for a plugin

There is a [library of plugins](plugin) that you can use in your apps or you can use to learn how create your own plugins.

## Quickstart

You can follow the [tutorial](cmd/myapp/README.md) to quickly get the sample app up and running locally.

## Plugin Development Guide

You can follow the [Plugin Development Guide](PLUGIN.md) to build your own plugins.

## Screenshots

Below are screenshots of the sample app with links to the plugins to help explain the architecture.

The terminal shows the [logger plugin](plugin/logruslogger/logruslogger.go) that outputs based on log level.

The home screen is from the [simplelogin plugin](plugin/simplelogin/simplelogin.go) and demonstrates the styling from the [bearcss plugin](plugin/bearcss/bearcss.go). Routing is handled through the [awayrouter plugin](plugin/awayrouter/awayrouter.go).

![Home](doc/screenshot/home.png)

The login page takes a username and password (handled by the [simplelogin plugin](plugin/simplelogin/simplelogin.go)). The password hash is read from the environment variable: `AMB_PASSWORD_HASH`. The [scssession plugin](plugin/scssession/scssession.go) handles the session creation and stores to the local filesystem, but supports any storage system via a plugin that satisfies the [`SessionStorer`](ambient_sessionstorer.go) interface.

![Login](doc/screenshot/login.png)

The [pluginmanager plugin](plugin/pluginmanager/pluginmanager.go) provides an easy way to modify plugins.

![Plugin Manager](doc/screenshot/pluginmanager.png)

The settings page (part of the [pluginmanager plugin](plugin/pluginmanager/pluginmanager.go)) allows you to customize the value that gets displayed in the meta tag that is set by the [author plugin](plugin/author/author.go).

![Settings](doc/screenshot/settings.png)

The grants page (part of the [pluginmanager plugin](plugin/pluginmanager/pluginmanager.go)) allows you to allow or deny modifications to the app by the [author plugin](plugin/author/author.go).

![Grants](doc/screenshot/grants.png)

Once enabled, the [author plugin](plugin/author/author.go) modifies the HTML header (through the [htmlengine plugin](plugin/htmlengine/htmlengine.go)) to add in a meta tag with the value from the settings page.

![HTML](doc/screenshot/htmlauthor.png)

The backend storage is provided by the [gcpbucketstorage plugin](plugin/gcpbucketstorage/gcpbucketstorage.go) and is stored in a JSON file on the local filesystem, but supports any storage system via a plugin that satisfies the [`DataStorer`](ambient_datastorer.go) interface.
