# Ambient üèñÔ∏è

[![GitHub Actions status](https://github.com/josephspurrier/ambient/actions/workflows/unit-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/josephspurrier/ambient/actions)

Pluggable blogging system for a single author. Written in Go and deploys to your own GCP project with a few commands. This project uses `make` to simplify the deployment process.

## Quickstart on Local

- Clone the repository: `git@github.com:josephspurrier/polarbearblog.git`
- Create a new file called `.env` in the root of the repository with this content:

```bash
# App Configuration
## Session key to encrypt the cookie store. Generate with: make privatekey
AMB_SESSION_KEY=
## Password hash that is base64 encoded. Generate with: make passhash passwordhere
AMB_PASSWORD_HASH=
## Username to use to login to the platform at: https://example.run.app/login/admin
AMB_USERNAME=admin
## Enable use of HTML in markdown editors.
AMB_ALLOW_HTML=false
## GCP bucket name (this can be one that doesn't exist yet).
AMB_GCP_BUCKET_NAME=sample-bucket
## Optional: enable MFA (TOTP) that works with apps like Google Authenticator. Generate with: make mfa
# AMB_MFA_KEY=
## Optional: set the time zone from here:
## https://golang.org/src/time/zoneinfo_abbrs_windows.go
# AMB_TIMEZONE=America/New_York

# GCP Deployment
## GCP project ID.
AMB_GCP_PROJECT_ID=my-sample-project-191923
## Name of the docker image that will be created and stored in GCP Repository.
AMB_GCP_IMAGE_NAME=sample-image
## Name of the Cloud Run service to create.
AMB_GCP_CLOUDRUN_NAME=sample-service
## Region (not zone) where the Cloud Run service will be created:
## https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones#available
AMB_GCP_REGION=us-central1

# MFA Configuration
## Friendly identifier when you generate the MFA string.
AMB_ISSUER=www.example.com

# Local Development
## Set this to any value to allow you to do testing locally without GCP access.
## See 'Local Development Flag' section below for more information.
AMB_LOCAL=true
```

- To generate the `AMB_SESSION_KEY` variable for .env, run: `make privatekey`. Overwrite the line in the `.env` file.
- To generate the `AMB_PASSWORD_HASH` variable for .env, run: `make passhash passwordhere`. Replace with your password. Overwrite the line in the `.env` file.
- To create the session and site files in the storage folder, run: `make local-init`
- To start the webserver on port 8080, run: `make local-run`

The login page is located at: http://localhost:8080/login/admin.

To login, you'll need:

- the username from the .env file for variable `AMB_USERNAME` - the default is: `admin`
- the password from the .env file for which the `AMB_PASSWORD_HASH` was derived

Once you are logged in, you should see a new menu option call `Dashboard`. From this screen, you'll be able to make changes to the site as we as the home page. To add new posts, click on `Posts` and add the posts or pages from there.

## Quickstart on GCP

By following these instructions, you can get a blog public easily:

- Create a Google GCP project
- Update the .env file with your information - see section above for content
- Run this command to initialize the store by creating the GCP bucket, enabling versioning, and then copying 2 blank files to the bucket: `make gcp-init`. You will need to have the [Google Cloud SDK installed](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install). You will also need a [service account key](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey) downloaded on your system with an environment variable set to the JSON file like this: `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=~/gcp-cloud-key.json`.
- Run this command to build the docker image, push to the Google repository, and then create a Cloud Run job: `make`.

Once the process completes in a few minutes, you should get a URL to access the website. The login page is located at (replace with your real URL): https://example.run.app/login/admin.

## Development

If you would like to make changes to the code, I recommend these tools to help streamline your workflow.

```bash
# Install air to allow hot reloading so you can make changes quickly.
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cosmtrek/air/master/install.sh | sh -s

# Install direnv and hook into your shell. This allows you to manage 
# https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html
```

Once you have `direnv` installed, create .envrc file. Update the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` variable to the correct location on your hard drive of the app credentials. You can generate and download a service account key from: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey.

```bash
# Load the shared environment variables (shared with Makefile).
# Export the vars in .env into the shell.
export $(egrep -v '^#' .env | xargs)

export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/bin
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=~/gcp-cloud-key.json
```

You can then use this commands to test and then to deploy.

```bash
# Start hot reload. The web application should be available at: http://localhost:8080
air

# Upload new version of the application to Google Cloud Run.
make
```

### Local Development Flag

When `AMB_LOCAL` is set, the following things will happen:

- data storage will be the local filesystem instead of in Google Cloud Storage
- redirects will no be attempted so you can use localhost:8080
- MFA, if enable will accept any number and will always pass validation
- Google Analytics will be disabled if set
- Disqus will be disabled if set
